# prototype-app

Prototype project to create a Sign in / Sign up modal that will show two fields: user and password.

## How to test the application
The supported operations based on the initial requirements are the following:

* Signing in as an Alpha brand, English language: [http://localhost:8080/prototype-app/login.html?brand=Alpha&lan=en](http://localhost:8080/prototype-app/login.html?brand=Alpha&lan=en)

* Signing in as an Alpha brand, Spanish language: [http://localhost:8080/prototype-app/login.html?brand=Alpha&lan=es](http://localhost:8080/prototype-app/login.html?brand=Alpha&lan=es)

* Signing in as a Beta brand, English language: [http://localhost:8080/prototype-app/login.html?brand=Beta&lan=en](http://localhost:8080/prototype-app/login.html?brand=Beta&lan=en)

* Signing in as a Beta brand, Spanish language: [http://localhost:8080/prototype-app/login.html?brand=Beta&lan=es](http://localhost:8080/prototype-app/login.html?brand=Beta&lan=es)


## Additional tests

The test will automatically run while building the maven project, however you can find them in the folder: src/text/java. 

The provided tests are just a reference of the main validations that the service layer performs, they're meant to exemplify how the full test will be done.
